# How to Download and Play GTA Vice City with Full Audio and Radio
 
GTA Vice City is one of the most popular and iconic games in the Grand Theft Auto series. Set in the 1980s, the game follows the story of Tommy Vercetti, a former mafia hitman who tries to make his own criminal empire in Vice City, a fictional version of Miami. The game features a huge open-world map, a variety of missions, vehicles, weapons, and characters, as well as an amazing soundtrack that includes radio stations with songs from the era.
 
However, some versions of GTA Vice City for PC may have issues with the audio and radio files, which can affect the gameplay experience. If you want to enjoy GTA Vice City with full audio and radio, you will need to download some additional files and follow some simple steps. Here is how you can do it:
 
**Download File ✵✵✵ [https://t.co/dbndETA9wZ](https://t.co/dbndETA9wZ)**


 
1. First, you will need to download GTA Vice City for PC from a reliable source. You can find different versions of the game on various websites, such as [Rockstar Games](https://www.rockstargames.com/games/vicecity), [Malavida](https://www.malavida.com/en/soft/gta-vice-city/), or [Archive](https://archive.org/details/grandtheftautovicecitypccdrom2003). Make sure you download the retail version or the repack version, not the rip version. The rip version is a compressed version that has some files removed, including the audio and radio files.
2. Next, you will need to download the audio and radio files separately. You can find them on various websites as well, such as [Mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/download/39c...), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1394TGY5czfwTEglgQ6wRsAV3gvEymqtx/view), or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5daIRSVnEo). The files are usually in a .rar format, which means you will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract them.
3. After you have downloaded both the game and the audio and radio files, you will need to install the game on your PC. To do this, you will need to extract the game files from the .zip or .rar file you downloaded. Then, you will need to open the DVD1 and DVD2 folders and mount them as virtual discs using a program like Daemon Tools or PowerISO. This will make your PC recognize them as actual discs. Then, you will need to run the setup.exe file from the DVD1 folder and follow the instructions. If it asks you where some file is located mid-installation, point it to the DVD2 folder.
4. Once you have installed the game, you will need to copy the audio and radio files to the game folder. To do this, you will need to extract the audio and radio files from the .rar file you downloaded. Then, you will need to open the folder where you installed the game (usually C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto Vice City) and paste the audio and radio files there. You may need to overwrite some existing files.
5. Finally, you will need to run the game using a cracked or fixed .exe file. This is because some versions of GTA Vice City may not work properly with modern operating systems or may require a CD-ROM to play. To avoid these issues, you will need to download a cracked or fixed .exe file from a website like [Piratebay](http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/567820...) or [Download Finder 007](https://filehare.com/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-download/). Then, you will need to copy this file to the game folder and replace the original .exe file with it.

That's it! You should now be able to play GTA Vice City with full audio and radio on your PC. Enjoy!
