- Hunters are your only source of leather until you get cows or sheep, which you need for making clothing.[^2^]
- Build a forester lodge near a gatherer, herbalist, and hunter, as they all benefit from a forested area.[^2^]
- Firewood is very valuable for trading, as it is plentiful and in high demand.[^2^]
- Keep some laborers available to replace specialized workers that die or retire.[^2^]
- Farming is less efficient than gathering, but it can provide a variety of crops that can prevent diseases.[^2^]
- Don't build any structures unless you have all the materials needed for them, to avoid wasteful trips by your workers.[^2^]
