- Make sure you know about all the characters in the game. This sequel features a vast amount of characters that come with their own custom abilities and special moves. You can unlock them by playing the game, buying them with coins, or scanning them with telepods. Some characters are more useful than others depending on the level and the situation. For example, Yoda may be the best character in the game, as he can bounce around and destroy everything in his path[^1^]. Jar Jar Binks is actually useful too, as he can use his tongue to grab objects and enemies[^1^]. Experiment with different characters and see what works best for you.
- Use the Force for good or evil. Depending on which side you choose, you can use different powers to aid you in your quest. The birds can use the Force to push or pull objects, deflect lasers, or create shockwaves. The pigs can use the Force to choke enemies, throw objects, or create lightning. You can also use lightsabers, blasters, rockets, and other weapons to deal more damage. Be careful though, as some of these powers can backfire if you use them incorrectly.
- Find all the treasure maps. There are hidden treasure maps in some levels that will unlock bonus levels when you find them. These bonus levels are based on the original trilogy and feature classic characters and scenes from the movies. To find the treasure maps, you need to look for clues in the background or use certain characters to reveal them. For example, in level B1-9, you need to use Anakin's pod racer to break a wooden crate that contains a map[^1^]. In level P1-15, you need to use Darth Sidious' lightning to activate a switch that opens a door with a map[^1^]. These bonus levels are fun and challenging, so don't miss them.
- Swap characters as you play. You don't have to stick with the default character for each level. You can switch characters in the slingshot at any time by tapping on their icon at the bottom of the screen. You can also buy more character slots with coins or scan more telepods to increase your options. Swapping characters can help you overcome difficult obstacles or achieve higher scores by using different strategies.
- Watch videos for hints and walkthroughs. If you are stuck on a level or want to get three stars on every level, you can watch videos that show you how to do it. You can access these videos by tapping on the video icon at the top right corner of the screen. You can also watch videos from other players on YouTube or other websites that show you different ways to beat the game[^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. Watching videos can give you new ideas and insights on how to play better.
