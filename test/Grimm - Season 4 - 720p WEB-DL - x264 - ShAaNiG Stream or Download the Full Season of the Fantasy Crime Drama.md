One of the highlights of Grimm season 4 is the introduction of a new character, Trubel, a young female Grimm who becomes Nick's protÃ©gÃ© and ally. Trubel is played by Jacqueline Toboni, who impressed the producers with her audition tape and was cast without meeting them in person. Toboni brings a fresh and dynamic energy to the show, as well as a sense of vulnerability and humor. She also has great chemistry with the rest of the cast, especially David Giuntoli, who plays Nick.
 
Another aspect that makes Grimm season 4 stand out is the exploration of the Wesen world and its history. The season delves deeper into the origins and motivations of the Wesen Council, a secretive organization that governs the Wesen community and enforces its laws. The season also reveals more about the Royals, a powerful family that has ties to the Grimm lineage and seeks to control the world. The season also introduces new and exotic Wesen species, such as the GedÃ¤chtnis Esser, a memory-stealing octopus-like creature, and the Musai, a seductive snake-like creature that can induce madness.
 
Grimm season 4 is not only a captivating and entertaining season, but also a pivotal one that sets up the stage for the final two seasons of the show. The season ends with a shocking cliffhanger that changes everything for Nick and his friends. If you want to find out what happens next, you can download Grimm season 5 on ShAaNiG as well.
  
Grimm season 4 also showcases the growth and development of the main characters, as they face new challenges and dilemmas. Nick has to cope with the loss and regain of his Grimm powers, as well as the betrayal and transformation of his girlfriend Juliette, who becomes a Hexenbiest, a witch-like Wesen. Nick also has to deal with his complicated relationship with Adalind, a former enemy who is pregnant with his child. Nick's partner Hank and his friend Monroe also have their own struggles, as they try to balance their loyalty to Nick and their love for their Wesen partners, Rosalee and Zuri.
 
Meanwhile, Captain Renard, who is revealed to be a Royal bastard, has to survive an assassination attempt and a coup within his family. He also has to protect his daughter Diana, who is kidnapped by his brother Kenneth. Sergeant Wu, who learns the truth about the Wesen world, has to adjust to his new reality and overcome his trauma. And last but not least, Trubel has to find her place in the Grimm world and avoid the threats from various enemies, such as the FBI agent Chavez and the mysterious group known as the Black Claw.
 
In an interview with TV Guide, executive producer David Greenwalt said that Grimm season 4 is "the most intense season yet". He also said that the season is "about identity and destiny" for the characters. He added that the season is "full of surprises and twists" that will keep the viewers hooked. Co-executive producer Jim Kouf also said that the season is "a roller coaster ride" that will "take you places you never thought you'd go".
