To find out which version of the system you have, you can check the settings menu on your dashboard screen or look at the label on your SD card slot. You can also refer to this [website](https://www.nissanusa.com/connect.html) for more information on the different Nissan Connect systems.
 
Once you know which version of the system you have, you can search for the update file on Rapidshare using keywords like "Europe Nissan Connect 2012 2013 Rapidshare" or "Europe Nissan Connect 2014 2015 Rapidshare". You may find multiple results, so make sure you choose a reliable and verified source. You can also check the comments and ratings of other users to see if the file works well.
 
## Step 2: Download the update file to your computer
 
After you find the right update file for your system, you need to download it to your computer. To do this, you need to create a free account on Rapidshare or use an existing one. Then, you need to click on the download link and follow the instructions on the screen. You may have to wait for a few minutes or hours depending on the size of the file and your internet speed.
 
Once the download is complete, you should have a zip file or an iso file on your computer. You need to extract or mount this file using a software like WinZip or Daemon Tools. You should see a folder with several files inside, such as .fbl, .fda, .fpa, .ftr, .poi, etc. These are the files that contain the map data and software updates for your Nissan Connect navigation system.
 
## Step 3: Copy the update files to an SD card
 
The next step is to copy the update files to an SD card that is compatible with your Nissan Connect navigation system. You can use the same SD card that came with your vehicle or buy a new one with at least 8 GB of storage space. Make sure you format the SD card to FAT32 before copying the files.
 
To copy the files, you need to insert the SD card into your computer's card reader or use an adapter. Then, you need to open the folder with the update files and select all of them. You can use Ctrl+A or Command+A to do this quickly. Next, you need to right-click on any of the selected files and choose "Copy". Then, you need to open the SD card folder and right-click on an empty space and choose "Paste". This will copy all the update files to your SD card.
 
## Step 4: Insert the SD card into your vehicle's slot and start the update
 
The final step is to insert the SD card into your vehicle's slot and start the update process. To do this, you need to turn on your vehicle's ignition and switch on your dashboard screen. Then, you need to eject your old SD card from the slot and insert your new one with the update files. You should see a message on your screen asking if you want to update your system. You need to confirm by pressing "Yes" or "OK".
